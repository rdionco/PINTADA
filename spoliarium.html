          The film depicts a devastation scene at a Roman circus, as dead gladiators are stripped of their weapons and garments.
        </p>
        <p>The painting reflects Luna’s deep nationalism and his yearning for freedom and justice for the Filipino people. Spoliarium became a powerful symbol, inspiring Filipinos to resist the political oppression enforced by Spanish colonial rule.
