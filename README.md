PINTADA is an online gallery made to present meaningful artworks that reflect Filipino history, culture, and experiences. The website allows visitors to view selected paintings and understand the stories and emotions behind them. It aims to make art more accessible and to encourage appreciation for the messages that each artwork carries.

This project was created through the teamwork of several members. Rein Dionco developed the website and handled its technical structure. Casey Labrague led the project and guided its overall direction. Briana Loyola organized and planned the content of the gallery. Robyn Arcilla designed the layout and user interface to make the site clear and easy to use. Eliza Butas worked on research and documentation to support the information provided. Dustin Telmo edited video content used in the project.

Together, the team built PINTADA to share and preserve important artworks in a simple and meaningful way.
