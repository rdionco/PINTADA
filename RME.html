                    "Rape and Masscre in Ermita" was painted by a Filipino artist named Diosdado Lorenzo during the post-World War II in 1947, that depicts the 	     horror experienced by civilians during the Japanese occupation of Manila. The artwork portrays a family under attack which highlighted the 	     sexual violence experienced by women and the brutal killing of men that transpired in Ermita. Lorenzo uses a dramatic composition that has dark 	     tones and expressive figures to convey the immense chaos and fear that people lived in that was led by wartime cruelty.
                </br>The painting serves as a reminder that despite carrying the heavy burden of trauma caused by the war, Filipinos have remained resilient.
