          <strong>“Doomed Family” </strong> was a painting by Dominador Castañeda that depicts a family that was harmed during the Japanese Occupation. It shows a man tied with a rope, a child in distressm and a lifeless woman lying on the floor. This portrays the mournful violence experienced by the civilians where countless families have been torn apart, losing there loved ones. The painting contains dark tones and heavy emotion that captures the brutality of war and how it runs a deep emotional cut to each individual.
